The least recently used (LRU) page replacement algorithm, though similar 
in name to NRU, differs in the fact that LRU keeps track of page usage 
over a short period of time, while NRU just looks at the usage in the 
last clock interval. 

LRU works on the idea that pages that have been most heavily used in 
the past few instructions are most likely to be used heavily in the 
next few instructions too. 

While LRU can provide near-optimal performance in theory 
(almost as good as Adaptive Replacement Cache), it is rather expensive 
to implement in practice. 

There are a few implementation methods for this algorithm that try to 
reduce the cost yet keep as much of the performance as possible.
